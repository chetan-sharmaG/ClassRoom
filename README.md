Ever wondered if a classroom could be more than just a room with four walls? Welcome to ClassRoom, the digital platform that adds a dash of fun and a ton of efficiency to your educational journey. Designed with a focus on streamlining student engagement and facilitating seamless communication within educational institutions, ClassRoom is the one-stop solution for all your academic needs.

ClassRoom is built using Flutter, making it a cross-platform mobile application that brings a seamless and engaging user experience to your fingertips.

## What's ClassRoom All About?

Think of ClassRoom as your personal academic assistant who wears many hats - a note organizer, a calendar manager, an announcement broadcaster, a friendly directory, and much more. But, unlike your dog, it won't chew up your notes or spill coffee on your calendar. Instead, ClassRoom keeps everything organized, accessible, and more importantly, coffee-free!

## Key Features: 

### The "Open Sesame" - Login and Registration Mechanism

Did we mention our registration process is as easy as scanning a barcode? Well, it is! Students can register using their unique registration number obtained by scanning the barcode on their ID cards. Top it up with email verification using Firebase authentication, and you get secure access to the platform. No magical phrases needed, just a scan and you're in!
